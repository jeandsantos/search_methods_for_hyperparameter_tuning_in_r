# search_methods_for_hyperparameter_tuning_in_r
Use various search methods in finding the optimal values of hyperparameters of a machine learning model. The population-based search methods to be tested are genetic algorithms (GA), differential evolution (DE) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Grid and random search will also be performed and used as benchmarks.
